1) If can kill opponent and not kill myself - shoot and trigger
2) Silence in the longest path direction, not in random direction
3) Find longest path via bfs, not dfs
4) Opponent tail cannot be crossed while silencing (thus less possible positions)
5) When longest path analyze how your position can be detected
6) When starting not in random position, but precalculate path with min position reduction
